-- Eihort localization file for English
-- Ãœbersetzte Version: 20180204-1310

-- Notes:
--  - Localization files should be stored in UTF8 encoding and be named as
--    "<language code>.txt". The language code should be lowercase.
--  - Country-specific language files can be created, e.g. en_ca.txt, which
--    override any settings in the main language file (in this case en.txt).
--  - Lines beginning with -- are ignored
