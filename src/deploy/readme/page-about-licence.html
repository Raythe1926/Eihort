						<p>Three papers discussing aspects of Triangle are available.  A short overview appears in "Triangle:  Engineering a 2D Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator," in Applied Computational Geometry:  Towards Geometric Engineering, Ming C. Lin and Dinesh Manocha, editors, Lecture Notes in Computer Science volume 1148 pages 203-222, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, May 1996 (from the First ACM Workshop on Applied Computational Geometry). [*]</p>
						<p>The algorithms are discussed in the greatest detail in "Delaunay Refinement Algorithms for Triangular Mesh Generation," Computational Geometry:  Theory and Applications 22(1-3):21-74, May 2002.  [*]</p>
						<p>More detail about the data structures may be found in my dissertation: "Delaunay Refinement Mesh Generation," Ph.D. thesis, Technical Report CMU-CS-97-137, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 18 May 1997.  [*]</p>
						<p>Triangle was created as part of the Quake Project in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.  For further information, see Hesheng Bao, Jacobo Bielak, Omar Ghattas, Loukas F. Kallivokas, David R. O'Hallaron, Jonathan R. Shewchuk, and Jifeng Xu, "Large-scale Simulation of Elastic Wave Propagation in Heterogeneous Media on Parallel Computers," Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 152(1-2):85-102, 22 January 1998.</p>
						<p>Triangle's Delaunay refinement algorithm for quality mesh generation is a hybrid of one due to Jim Ruppert, "A Delaunay Refinement Algorithm for Quality 2-Dimensional Mesh Generation," Journal of Algorithms 18(3):548-585, May 1995 [*], and one due to L. Paul Chew, "Guaranteed-Quality Mesh Generation for Curved Surfaces," Proceedings of the Ninth Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry (San Diego, California), pages 274-280, Association for Computing Machinery, May 1993, http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=161150 .</p>
						<p>The Delaunay refinement algorithm has been modified so that it meshes domains with small input angles well, as described in Gary L. Miller, Steven E. Pav, and Noel J. Walkington, "When and Why Ruppert's Algorithm Works," Twelfth International Meshing Roundtable, pages 91-102, Sandia National Laboratories, September 2003.  [*]</p>
						<p>My implementation of the divide-and-conquer and incremental Delaunay triangulation algorithms follows closely the presentation of Guibas and Stolfi, even though I use a triangle-based data structure instead of their quad-edge data structure.  (In fact, I originally implemented Triangle using the quad-edge data structure, but the switch to a triangle-based data structure sped Triangle by a factor of two.)  The mesh manipulation primitives and the two aforementioned Delaunay triangulation algorithms are described by Leonidas J. Guibas and Jorge Stolfi, "Primitives for the Manipulation of General Subdivisions and the Computation of Voronoi Diagrams," ACM Transactions on Graphics 4(2):74-123, April 1985, http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=282923 .</p>
						<p>Their O(n log n) divide-and-conquer algorithm is adapted from Der-Tsai Lee and Bruce J. Schachter, "Two Algorithms for Constructing the Delaunay Triangulation," International Journal of Computer and Information Science 9(3):219-242, 1980.  Triangle's improvement of the divide-and-conquer algorithm by alternating between vertical and horizontal cuts was introduced by Rex A. Dwyer, "A Faster Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm for Constructing Delaunay Triangulations," Algorithmica 2(2):137-151, 1987.</p> 
						<p>The incremental insertion algorithm was first proposed by C. L. Lawson, "Software for C1 Surface Interpolation," in Mathematical Software III, John R. Rice, editor, Academic Press, New York, pp. 161-194, 1977. For point location, I use the algorithm of Ernst P. Mucke, Isaac Saias, and Binhai Zhu, "Fast Randomized Point Location Without Preprocessing in Two- and Three-Dimensional Delaunay Triangulations," Proceedings of the Twelfth Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry, ACM, May 1996.  [*]  If I were to randomize the order of vertex insertion (I currently don't bother), their result combined with the result of Kenneth L. Clarkson and Peter W. Shor, "Applications of Random Sampling in Computational Geometry II," Discrete & Computational Geometry 4(1):387-421, 1989, would yield an expected O(n^{4/3}) bound on running time.</p>
						<p>The O(n log n) sweepline Delaunay triangulation algorithm is taken from Steven Fortune, "A Sweepline Algorithm for Voronoi Diagrams", Algorithmica 2(2):153-174, 1987.  A random sample of edges on the boundary of the triangulation are maintained in a splay tree for the purpose of point location.  Splay trees are described by Daniel Dominic Sleator and Robert Endre Tarjan, "Self-Adjusting Binary Search Trees," Journal of the ACM 32(3):652-686, July 1985, http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3835 .</p>
						<p>The algorithms for exact computation of the signs of determinants are described in Jonathan Richard Shewchuk, "Adaptive Precision Floating-Point Arithmetic and Fast Robust Geometric Predicates," Discrete &      Computational Geometry 18(3):305-363, October 1997.  (Also available as Technical Report CMU-CS-96-140, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, May 1996.)  [*] An abbreviated version appears as Jonathan Richard Shewchuk, "Robust Adaptive Floating-Point Geometric Predicates," Proceedings of the Twelfth Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry, ACM, May 1996. [*] Many of the ideas for my exact arithmetic routines originate with Douglas M. Priest, "Algorithms for Arbitrary Precision Floating Point Arithmetic," Tenth Symposium on Computer Arithmetic, pp. 132-143, IEEE Computer Society Press, 1991.  [*]  Many of the ideas for the correct evaluation of the signs of determinants are taken from Steven Fortune and Christopher J. Van Wyk, "Efficient Exact Arithmetic for Computational Geometry," Proceedings of the Ninth Annual Symposium on          Computational Geometry, ACM, pp. 163-172, May 1993, and from Steven Fortune, "Numerical Stability of Algorithms for 2D Delaunay Triangulations," International Journal of Computational Geometry & Applications 5(1-2):193-213, March-June 1995.</p>
						<p>The method of inserting new vertices off-center (not precisely at the circumcenter of every poor-quality triangle) is from Alper Ungor, "Off-centers:  A New Type of Steiner Points for Computing Size-Optimal Quality-Guaranteed Delaunay Triangulations," Proceedings of LATIN 2004 (Buenos Aires, Argentina), April 2004.</p>
						<p>For definitions of and results involving Delaunay triangulations, constrained and conforming versions thereof, and other aspects of triangular mesh generation, see the excellent survey by Marshall Bern and David Eppstein, "Mesh Generation and Optimal Triangulation," in Computing and Euclidean Geometry, Ding-Zhu Du and Frank Hwang, editors, World Scientific, Singapore, pp. 23-90, 1992.  [*]</p>
						<p>The time for incrementally adding PSLG (planar straight line graph) segments to create a constrained Delaunay triangulation is probably O(t^2) per segment in the worst case and O(t) per segment in the common case, where t is the number of triangles that intersect the segment before it is inserted.  This doesn't count point location, which can be much more expensive.  I could improve this to O(d log d) time, but d is usually quite small, so it's not worth the bother. (This note does not apply when the -s switch is used, invoking a different method is used to insert segments.)</p>
						<p>The time for deleting a vertex from a Delaunay triangulation is O(d^2) in the worst case and O(d) in the common case, where d is the degree of the vertex being deleted.  I could improve this to O(d log d) time, but d is usually quite small, so it's not worth the bother.</p>
						<p>Ruppert's Delaunay refinement algorithm typically generates triangles at a linear rate (constant time per triangle) after the initial triangulation is formed.  There may be pathological cases where quadratic time is required, but these never arise in practice.</p>
						<p>The geometric predicates (circumcenter calculations, segment intersection formulae, etc.) appear in my "Lecture Notes on Geometric Robustness" at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/mesh .</p>
						<p>If you make any improvements to this code, please please please let me know, so that I may obtain the improvements.  Even if you don't change the code, I'd still love to hear what it's being used for.</p>
